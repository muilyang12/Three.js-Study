# Three.js Study

## Overview

- This repository is a collection of several examples created using **Three.js**. The projects cover a range of 3D graphics concepts, from basic transformations to more complex scenes involving physics and lighting.
- I created most examples with watching YouTube videos of [GIS Developer Youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGACJosABBw&list=PLe6NQuuFBu7HqxY10b6gNu6iisT2-rZv-&index=1&ab_channel=GISDEVELOPER).

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Three.js
- Ammo.js for physics simulations
- Webpack for bundling
- HTML/CSS

## Examples

Below are the examples included in this repository.

1. **Rotating Box & Bouncing Sphere**

   - A rotating box with a bouncing sphere to demonstrate basic object animation and interaction.

8. **Domino Effect**

   - A domino simulation using Ammo.js for physics simulation and Three.js for rendering the domino objects and scene.
   - [View Example](https://muilyang12.github.io/Three.js-Study/08.Domino/dist/)

9. **Vehicle Collision**
   - A simple vehicle collision simulation using Ammo.js for physics and Three.js for modeling and rendering the vehicles and collision environment.
